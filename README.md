# Albumin Diet Mobile App

## Overview

Albumin Diet is an application that aims to make a music streaming platform (Spotify) less playlist-centric and more album oriented.
With Albumin Diet you can:

* Tag your saved albums with your custom-made tags
* Browse your saved albums by tag
* Save an album in your listening-list and listen to them later

## Try it

**N.B.** This is intended to be a POC and is using a free DBaaS with limited storage available. All your data may be lost without warning.

### Android

Albumin Diet for Android can be installed from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gianlucaparadise.albumindietmobapp).

### iOS

Albumin Diet for iOS is fully working, but it has not been published yet because I can't afford the Apple Developer License ðŸ˜¢

However, you can use the web version: www.albumindiet.ml

## Ecosystem

Albumin Diet has born to test the capabilities of several technologies. The whole ecosystem is made of the following applications:

## Tech notes

I used this project to test the capabilities of the following technologies:

* React Native
* Typescript (to test React Native compatibility)
* Redux pattern
